      description:
        Ethio is a RESTful API with the primary goal of being a simple and humane way to get
        information from the Ethereum blockchain.

        The _RESTful_ part is important because it makes Ethio like most APIs that web developers are used to.

        In that way, Ethio is similar to
        [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api){:target='_blank'},
        [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api){:target='_blank'},
        [GitHub](https://developer.github.com){:target='_blank'},
        [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer){:target='_blank'},
        and
        [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com){:target='_blank'}
        APIs.

      heading: Why Ethio?

      description:
        Ethio is purpose built to be easy for web developers.
        Working with the Ethereum blockchain should as simple as any web API.
        If you’ve ever used a RESTful API on the web (Twitter, Facebook, Intagram, etc),
        using Ethio will feel familiar.


        Ethio was born out of a frustration with the existing tools not being RESTful or opensource.
        (Or neither!) Ethio comes from the idea that REST and opensource are both important.


        The most common way that most people work with the Ethereum blockchain is some combination of

        [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io){:target='_blank'},
        [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js){:target='_blank'},
        and
        [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org){:target='_blank'}
        (or [Parity](https://www.parity.io)).

        None of which are RESTful, and all of which use a format called
        [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC){:target='_blank'}
        (unlike most web APIs).


        [Infura](https://infura.io){:target='_blank'} has a REST-like API, but is not opensource.
        Infura also suffers from the same functionality limitations as a raw Geth node,
        namely search / filtering / associations are somewhere between very inefficient to completely
        impossible when operating directly on the blockchain.


        If you are happy using Web3 / Infura / Etherscan, great! You should keep using them.
        RPC is a different mental model than REST, and some people really like that.

        But if you’re looking for a RESTful experience that is like most other web APIs,
        then Ethio will soon be for the thing for you. Stay tuned…
