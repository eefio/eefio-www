      description:
        Ethio is a RESTful API with the primary goal of being a simple and humane way to get information from the Ethereum blockchain.

        The _RESTful_ part is important because it makes Ethio like most APIs that web developers are familiar with.

        In that way, Ethio is similar to

        [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api){:target='_blank'},
        [GitHub](https://developer.github.com){:target='_blank'},
        [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer){:target='_blank'},
        and

        APIs.
